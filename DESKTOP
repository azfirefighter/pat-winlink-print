#-------- DESKTOP --------
There are are TWO variables that need to replaced with actual information.
1. $WORKING.....should be changed to the directory that you're currently in
                (/home/USERNAME/pat-winlink-print)
2. $APPNAME.....should always be pat-print-gui

Change them below, then copy the text between START and END into a new
text file named "pat-winlink-print.desktop".

Move the "pat-winlink-print.desktop" file to
/home/USERNAME/.local/share/applications.

Log out and back in and it should be in your menu.
