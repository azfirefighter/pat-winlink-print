#-------- PRINTCONFIG --------

The "selenium-print.py" script is what actually prints the message, so it's important to set it
to print the correct file.

Open the script in a text editor and look for the line that says:

DIR=".FIXME."

Replace .FIXME with:

file:///home/USERNAME/pat-winlink-print/build/print.html

Remember to keep that between the quotation marks.
