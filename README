WARRANTY

The scripts are not provided with any warranty for fitness for any purpose.
I may or not update them.  I will provide any changes I make to the repo, but otherwise provide NO SUPPORT.  If you make it work better, I'd appreciate
a heads up so I can roll your changes into the repo (with appropriate credit).

LICENSES
---------------
If you received these scripts without a GNU GPLv3 license file, please obtain it at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt.
The scripts contained in this repo are licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (see LICENSE).
You are REQUIRED to provide the complete source code under the SAME licence (per the terms of the GPLv3) if you make any changes.
The additional programs required for pat-winlink-print to function are licensed separately (see the source code for each for more information).

FOR
---------------
Pat v0.12.1 (unknown origin) linux/amd64 - go1.17.3
Also known as "pat-winlink"

ASSUMES
---------------
1. You have started pat-winlink with the "pat-winlink http" command.
2. You have downloaded the messages from the CMS (either by radio or telnet).
3. You've opened a message and want to print it.

WHAT
---------------
A rough BASH user interface to allow me to select which directory to go to and which message to print.

WHY
---------------
The current version of pat-winlink (Pat v0.12.1 (unknown origin) linux/amd64 - go1.17.3) doesn't provide a way to print your messages.

DIRECTORIES
---------------
It'll work a lot better if you keep the scripts in your home directory under a "pat-winlink-print" directory, or you'll have to modify all of the scripts.

REQUIRES
---------------
BASH shell
dos2unix
python3
python3-selenium from your distro
firefox (because that's what I use)
pat-winlink
dialog
cat, date, awk, sed, tr, basename, grep, ps, cut, head, kill, rm (standard in all distros)

A CALLSIGN LOGO (MUST be in the pat-winlink-print directory, AND be a 758x120px PNG file!)

BEFORE RUNNING
---------------
1. Make your callsign logo as above using whatever graphics program you prefer.  Just make sure it's 758x120px and that it's saved as a PDF file
   in the pat-winlink-print directory.  It MUST be named <CALLSIGN>.png!

2. Edit the pat-print-gui file:
      Replace CALLSIGNREPLACE with your actual callsign.
      Change the working directory to where ever you put these scripts if you absolutely didn't want them in the default directory.
           You'll have to change the directory in selenium-print.py to reflect what ever you changed it to (see the DIR variable in the file).

RUNNING
---------------
1. Write down the message ID from the message you want to print.
2. Because of the way dialog works, you can use your mouse to highlight the directory by double-clicking, then you MUST select it with <SPACE> and press enter.
   Then you'll highlight the message file using the same method.  ONLY <SPACE> will select the file.  Then press enter.
   
3. Firefox will pop up a new window with the file to be printed, send it to your printer and then close itself.  So far, I can have Firefox open at the same time and this only
   kills the pop-up window from the script.

4. Click okay to exit the program.
