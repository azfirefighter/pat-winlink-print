WARRANTY
---------------
The scripts are not provided with any warranty for fitness for any purpose.
I may or not update them.  I will provide any changes I make to the repo, but
otherwise provide NO SUPPORT.  If you make it work better, I'd appreciate
a heads up so I can roll your changes into the repo (with appropriate credit).

LIABILITY
---------------
You've downloaded something from the internet and starting running it in a shell
causing it to start executing commands.  I'm not liable for anything you do with
these scripts or if they damage your computer, cause your house to burn down,
start WW III, stop global warming (though I'd happily take credit for THAT one)
or anything else you can think of.  It's up to YOU to examine the scripts to
make sure they won't screw up your system or send me every penny you have in
your bank account.  If you can't understand the scripts, DON'T USE THEM!

LICENSES
---------------
If you received these scripts without a GNU GPLv3 license file, please obtain it
at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt.  The scripts contained in this repo
are licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (see LICENSE).
You are REQUIRED to provide the complete source code under the SAME licence
(per the terms of the GPLv3) if you make any changes.  The additional programs
required for pat-winlink-print to function are licensed separately
(see the source code for each for more information).

FOR
---------------
Pat v0.12.1 (unknown origin) linux/amd64 - go1.17.3
Also known as "pat-winlink"

ASSUMES
---------------
1. You have started pat-winlink with the "pat-winlink http" command.
2. You have downloaded the messages from the CMS (either by radio or telnet).
3. You've opened a message and want to print it.

WHAT
---------------
A rough BASH user interface to allow me to select which directory to go to and
which message to print.

WHY
---------------
The current version of pat-winlink
(Pat v0.12.1 (unknown origin) linux/amd64 - go1.17.3) 
doesn't provide a way to print your messages.

DIRECTORIES
---------------
It'll work a lot better if you keep the scripts in your home directory under a 
"pat-winlink-print" directory, or you'll have to modify all of the scripts.

REQUIRES
---------------
BASH shell
dos2unix
python3
python3-selenium from your distro
firefox (because that's what I use)
pat-winlink
zenity

A CALLSIGN LOGO (MUST be in the pat-winlink-print directory, AND be a
758x120px PNG file!)

BEFORE RUNNING
---------------
1. Make your callsign logo as above using whatever graphics program you prefer. 
      Just make sure it's 758x120px and that it's saved as a PDF file
      in the pat-winlink-print directory.  It MUST be named <CALLSIGN>.png!

2. Edit the pat-print-gui file:
      Replace CALLSIGNREPLACE with your actual callsign.
      Change the working directory to where ever you put these scripts if you
      absolutely didn't want them in the default directory.
      You'll have to change the directory in selenium-print.py to reflect what
      ever you changed it to (see the DIR variable in the file or the
      PRINTCONFIG file.).

3. The first time you run the script, it will perform some basic configuration
      that verifies the CALLSIGN.png file exists, your callsign has been added
      to the script and creates the necessary directories.  It will also create
      a file named ".setupdone".  This tells the program that setup has been
      completed.  If you delete this file, the next time you run the program,
      it will go back through the setup process, so leave it alone unless you
      want that.

RUNNING
---------------
1. Write down the message ID from the message you want to print.

2. The setup routine should've installed an icon in your menu that you can use
   to start the program.  If not, see the file "DESKTOP" for instructions.
   After clicking it, it will open a file chooser window in your pat-winlink
   local mailbox.
   
3.  Double-click on the directory that has the message you want to print and
    then double click on the appropriate message file (you DID right the
    message number down, right).
   
4. Firefox will pop up a new window with the file to be printed, send it to
   your printer and then close itself.  So far, I can have Firefox open at the
   same time and this only kills the pop-up window from the script.

5. Click okay to exit the program.
